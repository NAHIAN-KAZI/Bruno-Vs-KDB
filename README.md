Kevin De Bruyne and Bruno Fernandes Radar Chart Comparison
This repository contains the code and data for the radar chart comparing Kevin De Bruyne and Bruno Fernandes' performance in the Premier League 2021-22 season.

The code is written in Python and uses the matplotlib library to create the radar chart. The data is stored in a CSV file, which is also included in this repository.

To run the code, you will need to have Python installed. Once you have Python installed, you can open the radar_chart.py file in a text editor and change the path to the CSV file to the location where you have saved it. Then, you can run the code by typing the following command in the terminal:

python radar_chart.py

This will create the radar chart and save it as a PNG file.

The CSV file contains the following columns:

player_name: The name of the player
minutes_played: The number of minutes played by the player
goals: The number of goals scored by the player
xG: The expected goals scored by the player
assists: The number of assists provided by the player
xA: The expected assists provided by the player
touches: The number of touches taken by the player
acc_passes: The percentage of passes completed by the player
key_passes: The number of key passes made by the player
big_chances_created: The number of big chances created by the player
poss_lost: The number of times the player lost possession
acc_pass(%): The percentage of passes completed by the player
I hope this helps!
